# 🧾 Checkout Stepper

A simple and interactive **Checkout Stepper** built using **React**, designed as a machine coding round problem to demonstrate component-based design, state management, and UI logic handling.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Build a **multi-step checkout progress indicator** (Stepper) that visually represents the user's progress through multiple stages of a checkout flow.

Each step (e.g., Cart → Address → Payment → Summary) should:
- Highlight the current active step.
- Show completed steps with a filled indicator.
- Update dynamically as the user navigates forward or backward.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Dynamic step configuration via props.  
- Active and completed step highlighting.  
- Progress bar animation between steps.  
- Fully responsive and reusable React component.  
- Clean, modular, and readable code.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React (Hooks)** — component logic and rendering  
- **CSS** — styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — functional logic
